/*
Find chat identifiers, if any, that are defined in any two or more
of the following source:

  1. Contact group names view (based on the `group_title`) column
     of the 'message' chat.db table
  2. Manually defined contacts in the contacts_manual.csv table.
  3. Contacts table extracted in refresh_contacts.py.

For example, if the same contact is in your contacts AND in the
manual contacts table, one must be chosen to represent that
`chat_identifier`, so there must be a way to disambiguate.
That method of disambiguating is represented by the `priority`
column below. As such, these conflicts are able to be handled,
but ideally none would exist.

Use this query to identify duplicate contact chat identifiers,
then resolve them by making sure they appear in only one of
the preceding three sources.
