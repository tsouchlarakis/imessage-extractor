Welcome to the iMessage Extractor data workflow! This workflow
extracts iMessage data stored locally in a SQLite database,
'chat.db', and stores the results either as a series of text
files, or in a Postgres database. If the destination is a
Postgres database, then this workflow will define a series
of useful database views entirely for the user's querying
convenience.

This pipeline is entirely {click.style('non-destructive', bold=True)}, meaning
none of the original chat.db data is appended to, mutated or
deleted at any point.

Let's go!
