Welcome to {click.style('iMessage Extractor', bold=True)}! 👋

This workflow fetches iMessage chat data stored locally
in a SQLite database named {click.style('chat.db', bold=True)}, and stores the results
either as a series of text files, and/or in a Postgres database.
If the destination is a Postgres database, then this workflow
will define a series of useful database views entirely for
the user's querying convenience.

This pipeline is entirely {click.style('non-destructive', bold=True)}, meaning
none of the original chat.db data is appended to, mutated or
deleted at any point.

Let's go! ⚡️
