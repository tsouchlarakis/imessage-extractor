Welcome to {click.style('iMessage Extractor', bold=True)}! ðŸ‘‹

This workflow fetches iMessage chat data stored locally
in a SQLite database named {click.style('chat.db', bold=True)}, applies useful
transformations and defines handy views on top of the data,
and saves a readable & writable .db SQLite database locally.

It's entirely {click.style('non-destructive', bold=True)}, meaning none of the original
chat.db data is appended to, deleted or mutated in any way.
