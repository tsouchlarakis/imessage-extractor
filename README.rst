Extract local iMessage data to a Postgres database or flat textfiles on a Mac.

üèÅ Getting Started
=================

``imessage-extractor`` is a pip-installable python package designed to be run on macOS that extracts iMessage chat data stored locally in a SQLite database by macOS, and saves it to an array of flat .csv files or a Postgres database, or both.

üßø Prerequisites
----------------

* macOS
* Python 3.X
* pip


‚öí Installation
--------------

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install imessage-extractor

It really is that simple ‚úîÔ∏è

‚ö°Ô∏è Usage
-------

First, you'll want to make sure you have the iMessage SQLite database, called ``chat.db``, stored locally. By default on macOS, this database is stored in the ``~/Library/Messages`` directory. You can verify that it's there by runnning the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   FILE=~/Library/Messages/chat.db
   if [ -f "$FILE" ]; then
       echo "You're good!"
   else
       echo "Sadly, no file exists at $FILE - is it possible chat.db lives elsewhere on your system?"
   fi

Or by just navigating to that directory in Finder, and seeing whether a file called ``chat.db`` exists üôÇ

üåà Releasing
------------

``imessage-extractor`` utilizes `versioneer <https://pypi.org/project/versioneer/>`_ for versioning. This requires the ``versioneer.py`` in the project's top-level directory, as well as some lines in the package's ``setup.cfg`` and ``__init__.py``.

1. Make your changes locally and push to ``develop`` or a different feature branch.

2. Tag the new version. This will be the version of the package once publication to PyPi is complete.

   .. code-block:: bash

      git tag {major}.{minor}.{patch}

3. Publish to PyPi.

   .. code-block:: bash

      rm -rf ./dist && python3 setup.py sdist && twine upload -r pypi dist/*

4. Install the new version of ``imessage-extractor``.

   .. code-block:: bash

      pip install imessage-extractor=={major}.{minor}.{patch}

5. Create a `pull request <https://github.com/tsouchlarakis/imessage-extractor/pulls>`_.

‚öôÔ∏è Customization
===============

Here's where the fun begins! Because the use case for each user's iMessage history is slightly different, making custom changes to your local installation of ``imessage-extractor`` is encouraged and easy.
